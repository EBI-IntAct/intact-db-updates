remark: Notes:
remark: Each of the top level terms in this file is the root term of an independent controlled vocabulary
remark: mapping an element of the PSI Molecular Interaction XML schema.
remark: The correct use of these vocabularies in the PSI Molecular Interaction XML schema is
remark: formalized in a mapping file available at http://www.psidev.info/files/validator/xml/MI-CVMapping.xml.
remark: The PSI MI schema defines short labels for controlled vocabulary terms
remark: short labels are reported as PSI-MI-short synonyms that are created when a term is more than 20 characteres long.
remark: The last accession number used in this file is stored in a separate file,
remark: psi-mi.lastac. It MUST be updated when this file is updated.
remark: The maintenance of this file is ensured by Sandra Orchard orchard@ebi.ac.uk and Luisa Montecchi Palazzi luisa@ebi.ac.uk
remark: coverage: This file collect controlled vocabularies describing different aspects of molecular interactions.
remark: publisher: This file is published by the PSI MI working group see http://psidev.info/MI
remark: CVversion: 2.5.5

The components to be separated are distributed between two phases: a stationary phase (bed) and a mobile phase which percolates through the stationary bed. The nature of the two phases determines the separation criteria exploited by the column such as affinity, ionic charges, size or hydrophobicity of the molecules under analysis. Each type of column can be implemented with the mobile phase under atmospheric or high pressure condition. In this later case columns are designated as High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)."
